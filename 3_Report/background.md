# Detecting prescription cascades in drugs that may induce Parkinson-like symptoms:
## A prescription sequence symmetry study in the United Kingdom 

Prescription cascades refer to a situation where an adverse drug effect (ADE) is
misinterpreted as a new condition, prompting further drugs to be prescribed ([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34324873/),
[2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36045504/)). An example of this is Drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP).
DIP is a subtype of parkinsonism where it is associated with medications blocking dopamine receptors in the brain ([3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31865063/), 
[4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30687468/), [5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22523509/)). 


Prescription Sequence Symmetry Analysis (PSSA) is a signal detection method used to identify potential prescription cascades 
([1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34324873/), [6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25907076/), 
[7](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-023-02108-y)). 
In the light of this, the objective of this study is to detect signals, using PSSA, 
between the causative medications gathered from literature ([5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22523509/), [8](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36573102/)) and antiparkinsonian medications in the UK.
