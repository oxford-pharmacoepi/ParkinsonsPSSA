# Database connection details -----
# In this study we also use the DBI package to connect to the database
# set up the dbConnect details below

# for more details.
# you may need to install another package for this 
# eg for postgres

#   RPostgres::Postgres(),

#   port = port, 
#   host = host, 
#   user = user,
#   password = password

# be stored. 
# Notes: 
# - if there is an existing table in your results schema with the same names it
#   will be overwritten
# - more than one cohort will be created
# - name must be lower case

# Run the study ------
